                            <p style=color:black>I have learned to create a blockchain and also created a block chain which creates blocks one by one and it contains information and also every block has its own hash and previous hash.<br>Let's know more about <b style=color:black>Blockchain</b><br>
                            <b style=color:black>Definition:</b><br>A blockchain is a continuosly growing list of records,called blocks,which are linked and secured using cryptography.<br>
                            the concept of blockchain first came from<b style=color:black>Stuart Haber</b> and <b style=color:black>W.Scott Stornetta</b><br>
                            At starting i had many problems in understanding what is a block chain and how does it works by soon after making efforts and exploring new things i learned more about blockchain then soon after learning i was able to create a blockchain with every block having diffrent hash and previuos hash and you can also store data in it.</p>

                            A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets.Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.
